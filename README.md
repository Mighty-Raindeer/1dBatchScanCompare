# 1dBatchScanCompare
one dimensional scan gamma analysis for the purposes of annual profile comparisons. Export Onmi pro 6.X ASCII files for both reference and evaluation files to compare. There is no way to see if a beam is fff or not with ascii (to my knowledge) so you will have to split up by those measurements. Upload each and then run gamma, it will save a pdf with all gamma anaysis completed. there is an error bypass in the code so that it will just run through all the data sets without stopping. 

To do:
Clean up output so that it looks better (cpisper lines, better colors, maybe a logo)
add more info to title of page
find out about FFF
add pdf save to propt
add prompt to tell you if all tests were analyzed and why some weren't (the toughest task imo)
